### Purpose

The 73 Strings Code of Conduct (“Code”) is built around our belief that everything we do will be measured against the highest possible standards of ethical business conduct. Our commitment to high standards helps us hire great people, build great products, and attract loyal customers.

#### Who must follow the Code?

We expect all employees to know and follow the Code. Failure to do so can result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment. We also expect our contractors, consultants, and others who may be temporarily assigned to perform work or services for 73 Strings to follow the Code when they work with us. Failure of a 73 Strings contractor, consultant, or other service provider to follow the Code can result in termination of their relationship with 73 Strings.

#### Who to ask about the Code?

If you have a question or concern about the Code, be proactive and contact your manager. You can also submit a question or raise a concern regarding a suspected violation of our Code (or any other 73 Strings policy) to your manager.

#### No Retaliation

73 Strings prohibits retaliation against anyone who reports, or participates in an investigation of, a possible violation of our Code, our policies, or the law. Please contact a member of senior management if you believe that you are the subject of retaliation within 73 Strings.

#### Code of Conduct

As a 73 Strings employee, you’re expected to be honest, act ethically, and demonstrate integrity in all situations. You have a duty to follow policies and procedures found in this Code of Conduct, as well as those that are specific to your job. You must also comply with all laws that apply to our business. Most of the time, common sense and good judgment provide excellent guideposts. If you’re unsure about the right thing to do, ask someone on the management team. 

#### Before you act, ask yourself: 

*	Is this the right thing to do?
* 	Is it legal?
*	Do I have the authority to act?
*	Does the action comply with the Code of Conduct and policies and procedures?
*	If this action became public, how would it look in the news media?
*	Would I be upset or embarrassed if other people found out about this action?

If your answer to any of these questions raises doubts, talk with your supervisor, anyone in management, or the 73 Strings Compliance Officer. If you’re a supervisor or a manager, you’re responsible for knowing the rules and reviewing the Code of Conduct with the people who report to you to make sure they’re familiar with its contents. You’re also responsible for preventing violations of the Code, as well as detecting violations that may occur and reporting them appropriately. 

#### You’re expected to: 
*	Lead with integrity.
*  	Encourage employees to ask questions and expand their knowledge of the rules.
*	Demonstrate integrity by acting promptly and effectively when necessary.
*	Educate employees on compliance policies specific to their job responsibilities.

No one should bring a weapon to work under any circumstances. If you become aware of a violation of this policy, report it to a member of senior management immediately.

#### Avoid conflicts of interest

As 73 Strings employees, we should avoid conflicts of interest and circumstances that reasonably present the appearance of a conflict of interest, especially if it would create an incentive for you or present the appearance of an incentive for you, (whether directly or indirectly).

#### Personal Account Dealing Policy.

All employees of the 73 Strings (“Company”) are subject to a personal account dealing policy, which imposes certain restrictions, approval procedures and reporting requirements in relation to personal account dealing. The employee (individual) shall not use any information obtained in the course of his or her employment with the Company for personal financial gain. The personal account dealing policy requires employees to disclose all personal dealing and in some cases receive prior approval for personal account transactions. Employees are required to avoid any personal account transactions that may place them in conflict with the interests of either clients or Company. Restricted lists where Company is providing services to a particular person (E.g. a proposed acquirer of a company) or in relation to a particular person (eg the company proposed to be acquired), it may be appropriate that dealings in securities issued by one or more of such persons be restricted. Our Company maintains a restricted list. The restricted list provides the mechanism to communicate and apply any restrictions that may relate to certain business activities. Except where Company receives an unsolicited agency order in securities on the restricted list, no member of staff may, either for the firm’s Company account, a client’s account or their own personal account deal in any security for the time being included in the restricted list.

#### Protect 73 Strings’s Assets

*   Intellectual property

    73 Strings’s intellectual property rights (e.g. patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, and “know-how”) are valuable assets. Unauthorized use can lead to their loss or serious loss of value. You must comply with all intellectual property laws, including laws governing the fair use of copyrights and trademarks. You must never use 73 Strings’s trademarks or other protected information or property for any business or commercial venture without pre-clearance from the Marketing team. Report any suspected misuse of trademarks or other 73 Strings intellectual property to the Legal or compliance team.

    Likewise, respect the intellectual property rights of others. Inappropriate use of others’
    intellectual property may expose 73 Strings and you, to criminal, civil fines and penalties. Seek advice from the Legal team before you solicit, accept, or use proprietary information from individuals outside the company or allow them obtain access to 73 Strings proprietary information. You should also check with the Legal team if developing a product feature that uses content not belonging to 73 Strings.

*	Company Equipment

    73 Strings gives us the tools and equipment that we need to do our jobs effectively, but counts on us to be responsible and not wasteful. Uncertain whether personal use of company assets is okay? Ask your manager. 

*	The Network

    73 Strings’s network, software, and computing hardware are a critical aspect of our company’s physical property and intellectual property. Follow all security policies diligently. If you have any reason to believe that our network security has been violated – for example, you lose your laptop or think that your network password may have been compromised – promptly report the incident to your manager.  

*  	Physical Security

    Bad actors may steal company assets. Always secure your laptop, important equipment, and your personal belongings, even while on company premises. Promptly report any suspicious activity to your manager. 

#### Ensure financial integrity and responsibility

Financial integrity and fiscal responsibility are core aspects of corporate professionalism. Each person at 73 Strings has a role in making sure that money is appropriately spent, our financial records are complete and accurate, and internal controls are honored. This is applicable every time that we hire a new vendor, expense something to 73 Strings, or sign a new business contract.

It’s important that we also keep records for an appropriate length of time. 73 Strings’s Data Retention Policy suggests minimum record retention periods for certain types of records. These guidelines help keep in mind applicable legal requirements, accounting rules, and other external requirements. Contractual obligations may sometimes specify longer retention periods for certain types of records. In addition, if you are asked by the Legal team to retain records relevant to a litigation, audit, or investigation, do so until Legal tells you that retention is no longer necessary. If you have any questions regarding the correct length of time to retain a record, contact the Compliance or Legal teams.

#### Obey the law

73 Strings takes its responsibilities to comply with laws very seriously. Every employee is expected to comply with applicable legal requirements and restrictions. You should understand the laws and regulations that apply to your work. Contact the Compliance or Legal teams if you have any questions.
